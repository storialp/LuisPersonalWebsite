Building software with AI assistance is a different kind of fun. Here are some principles I try to follow:

## 1. Be the Architect, Not the Typist

Your job isn't to type code—it's to design systems. Let the AI handle the implementation details while you focus on the big picture.

## 2. Verify Everything

AI makes mistakes. Always review the code, especially around:
- Security implications
- Edge cases
- Integration points

## 3. Iterate Quickly

Don't spend hours perfecting a single prompt. Make small changes, test fast, and iterate. The best results come from rapid feedback loops.

## 4. Understand the Why

Don't just accept the AI's output. Understand *why* it chose a particular approach. This helps you catch issues and improves your own understanding.

## 5. Keep It Simple

AI can generate complex solutions. Your job is to push back and keep things simple. Complexity is the enemy of maintainability.
